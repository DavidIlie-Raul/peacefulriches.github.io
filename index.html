    windows, damaged items and lots of things that need repaired.
    There is stuff all over the home? You are holding on to things you haven’t used in years?
    There is a smell that is not pleasant (old furniture, sweat, food, animals, etc.)?
    This is how your home usually looks?
    You would feel embarrassed to let a very prosperous person you respect into your home.</label><br>

<label for="home-y"><input type="radio" id="home-y" class="Y" value="Y" name="home"><bold>Y:</bold> It is in decent condition, most things are in working order with a few things needing
    repair. There are some items sitting around on chairs and tables, but you clear up every
    now and then. It doesn’t smell good or bad, just a regular home smell.
    You have some things you don’t use, but generally you clear things out every few years?
    You clean the house frequently, but usually just when you have time to get around to it?
    You wouldn’t be embarrassed or proud to invite a very prosperous person you respect
    into your home.</label><br>

<label for="home-z"><input type="radio" id="home-z" class="Z" value="Z" name="home"><bold>Z:</bold> Your home is a place of joy and happiness for you? When you walk in it makes you feel
    happy and prosperous… it’s clean and tidy, everything has a place and is in its place? There
    is a regular cleaning schedule so everything is looking nice.
    You are excited to invite people to come and visit, and when they do they compliment
    how nice the place is?
    You regularly clear out any items you don’t use or need anymore, leaving only things you
    really like and use?
    There is a very nice smell that people comment on?
    You took time to design the rooms so they look nice, have good lighting, matching
    furniture and all the things you need to make your life flow? Even if you want a bigger or
    more luxury home in the future… it feels great now?</label><br>

    and fingerprints?
    It has a bad smell that would make a prosperous person feel uncomfortable?
    The seats have stains or burn marks on them?
    The gas tank is almost always near empty or in the red? When you fill it up you put the
    minimum in to get you to the next destination? The brakes make a bad noise or black
    smoke comes from the exhaust pipe?
    You would be embarrassed to give a ride to a prosperous person you respect?
    (if you don’t have a car and use public transport or regular taxi then choose this answer)</label><br>

<label for="car-y"><input type="radio" id="car-y" class="Y" value="Y" name="car"><bold>Y:</bold> Is the outside of your car cleaned when you get some time to do it? Generally its
    reasonably clean and you never let it get too dirty?
    The car has a few scratches or a new bump that you will get around to fixing soon, but
    nothing serious.
    You keep the gas tank somewhere in the middle, generally avoiding the red.
    You wouldn’t be proud or embarrassed to collect someone prosperous in the car? (if you
    don’t have a car and use uber/lyft, good taxi or similar)</label><br>

<label for="car-z"><input type="radio" id="car-z" class="Z" value="Z" name="car"><bold>Z:</bold> Your car is cleaned regularly and it has a nice shine to it, the only time it is dirty is after
    a long drive or when the weather has made it impossible to keep clean.
    You always fill the gas tank to full…when it gets below half you want to fill it back up.
    If the car has a dent or scratch you get it repaired quickly. Inside has a great smell that
    people notice when they get in.
    Even if you want a better car in the future…you feel proud to have prosperous people in
    your car right now because it is kept to a high standard?
    (if you don’t have a car and use and use only electric skateboard/scooter/bike/walking,
    luxury transport, Uber, Lyft, private jet, yacht)</label><br>
